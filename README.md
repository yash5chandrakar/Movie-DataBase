# Inspiration & Difficulties
This project challenged me in ways i couldnt think of. Firstly i learned about how to structure a proper database to store userData as well as movies data. Then i learned how to structure my backend using Node and Express. I also learned various new CSS properties while designing the frontEnd part. Overall i am satisfied with the project and i hope you like it.
