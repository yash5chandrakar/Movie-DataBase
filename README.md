# Inspiration
The idea to build this project came after i decided to build a full functioning E-Com Website. Basically i need to manage my database in a good manner so that it can be maintained when i start to use my E-COM Website. Maintaining Data which are needed for the website to work is a crucial job for a Full Stack Developer. Also i needed to take into account that these data can be changed at any time and the Main Website should reflect this positively. I learned various things from this project and it has accounted to my great growth in my backend skills. 
 
# How it Works
This website has 4 main routes :-
1. Home Page :- Home Page shows all the movies present in the DB.
2. MyMovies :- Here LoggedIn user can see his collection of movies as well as manage it.
3. Admin Page :- Here ADMIN users can manage all the users and also have the ability to change user roles.
4. LogIn/SignUp Page :- Users can login and sign up using this page.
